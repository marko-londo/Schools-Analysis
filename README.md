# Student Diversity in the U.S.

This repository contains several visualizations of student diversity in the U.S. based
on race (race_analysis.ipynb). It also shows Student-Teacher ratio data by
state (public_school_analysis.ipynb). The race_analysis notebook contains a
function that will take an input from the user and return a plot of student
demographics by state. The data used for this analysis is
sourced from the
public_school_data.csv file found in the resources folder.

## Barplot of Students by Race

The barplot above illustrates the distribution of students across different races in the U.S. It provides insights into the racial composition of students in educational institutions and highlights the importance of diversity and inclusivity in the education system.

The dataset used for this analysis includes information about students from various racial backgrounds, such as Asian, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander, and White. The barplot showcases the percentage or count of students belonging to each racial category, offering a visual representation of the diversity present within the student population.

## Methodology

To create the barplot, the following steps were taken:

1. Obtained the student data from the public_school_data.csv file in the resources folder.
2. Processed and cleaned the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
3. Utilized the seaborn library in Python to generate the barplot.
4. Customized the plot by adjusting the colors, labels, and other parameters.

## Usage

If you want to reproduce or explore the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/marko-londo/Schools-Analysis.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open and run the `bonus.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or any Python IDE.
4. Modify the notebook to suit your needs or use it as a reference for your own analysis.

Feel free to customize the code or adapt the analysis to fit your specific requirements.
